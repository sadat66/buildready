### 3. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Set Up Database

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Execute the SQL to create all tables, policies, and sample data
